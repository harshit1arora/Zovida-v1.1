# Zovida

**An AI-assisted patient safety companion for medication continuity**

----------

## Overview

In hospitals and outpatient settings, patients rarely move alone.  
They move with prescriptions, test reports, advice from multiple doctors, and assistance from family members and hospital staff.

Across this movement, patient safety quietly becomes everyone’s responsibility — yet no single system owns it.

**Zovida** is built to address this gap.  
It is an AI-assisted patient safety platform designed to remain with the patient across doctors, prescriptions, and care transitions, helping reduce medication-related safety risks caused by fragmented information.

----------

## Why This Matters

A typical patient journey is increasingly complex:

-   One doctor for diagnosis
    
-   Another for follow-up
    
-   A third for managing complications
    

Most patients consult **2–5 doctors** during a single treatment cycle.  
Each consultation often introduces new medicines, while previous prescriptions are rarely reviewed together.

Medication safety issues arise not because clinicians or patients are careless, but because **critical information is spread across disconnected points of care**.

----------

## The Problem

Medication safety failures are usually subtle, not dramatic.  
They appear as:

-   Two medicines that should not be taken together
    
-   Patients unsure which medication to continue or stop
    
-   Support staff attempting to help with incomplete information
    

Research indicates that **approximately 1 in 5 patients** experience medication-related issues during care transitions.

Today, these risks are managed manually through paper prescriptions, memory, and assumptions — leaving room for preventable harm.

----------

## How Zovida Began

During observations of hospital workflows and discussions with clinicians and support staff, a consistent pattern emerged:

-   Doctors focus on treatment decisions
    
-   Support staff focus on operational flow
    
-   Patients focus on recovery
    

However, no role has a continuous, consolidated view of medication safety throughout the patient’s journey.

Zovida was created to fill this gap — not by replacing clinical judgment, but by supporting it.

----------

## The Solution

Zovida is an **AI-assisted patient safety platform** that consolidates medications from multiple prescriptions into a single, continuous view.

It continuously checks for medication safety risks, including **drug–drug interactions**, across the patient’s complete medication history.

Zovida does **not** replace doctors.  
It acts as a **safety companion** for patients, caregivers, and healthcare staff by ensuring critical information is visible when it matters.

----------

## How It Works

1.  Patients upload prescriptions from different doctors
    
2.  Zovida reviews all medications together rather than in isolation
    
3.  Potential safety concerns are clearly highlighted
    
4.  Explanations are simple, multilingual, and patient-friendly
    

This approach transforms fragmented information into actionable clarity.

----------

## Key Features

Zovida focuses on a small set of essential safety capabilities:

-   **Drug–drug interaction detection** across all prescriptions
    
-   **Unified medication timeline** replacing scattered paper records
    
-   **Clear explanations** understandable by patients and families
    
-   **Interfaces designed for both patients and clinicians**
    

Each feature is intentionally designed to **reduce cognitive load**, not add complexity.

----------

## User Feedback

Early versions of Zovida were shared with patients and hospital support staff.

-   **10+ users** interacted with the prototype
    
-   Common feedback included:
    
    -   “It’s easier to see everything in one place.”
        
    -   “This gives more confidence while helping patients.”
        

These insights continue to guide product refinement.

----------

## Clinical Guidance & Responsibility

Healthcare demands caution and accountability.

Zovida is developed with guidance from medical professionals to ensure:

-   Clinical relevance
    
-   Responsible and explainable use of AI
    
-   Alignment with real hospital workflows
    

This ensures the platform grows safely, ethically, and in line with healthcare realities.

----------

## Market Need

-   Multi-doctor and chronic care journeys are increasing globally
    
-   Over **1 billion people worldwide** manage long-term or complex medication routines
    
-   In India, outpatient care frequently spans multiple clinics and specialists
    

This creates a growing need for tools that support **medication continuity and patient safety**.

Zovida is built **India-first**, with applicability to global healthcare systems.

----------

## Sustainability Model

Zovida follows a balanced approach:

-   Core safety features remain accessible to patients
    
-   Clinics and hospitals adopt the platform through subscriptions and partnerships
    

This model supports long-term sustainability while keeping patient safety at the center.

----------

## Team Philosophy

We are a team of technologists building with empathy and responsibility.

We believe patient safety should not depend on memory, paperwork, or chance.  
It should be supported by systems that work quietly and reliably in the background.

----------

## Closing

Zovida is designed to make medication safety continuous rather than episodic.

**Zovida — because safety should travel with the patient.**
